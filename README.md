# Simple_RK4_Solver

This is a repository for a simple implementation of the Runge-Kutta 4th order differential equation solver. It includes an example calculation of exponetial function. This has been implemented in python. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) for more details.
